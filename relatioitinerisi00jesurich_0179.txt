Page 35. The opposition of Claiborne 10 Lord Baltinwre's Col-
ony grew, as is well known, out of his Lordship's claim 10 Kent
Island, 011 which Claiborne had established scttlmnonts. Gov-
ernor Calvert had given Claiborne notice, during his visit 10 the
Governor of Virginia, 011 his way to the l'otomae, that he claimed
Kent Island as a part of his grant from the Crown. On 1110 14111

Captain William Claiborne, 011 the subject of Calvert⁷s 01111111 10
Κο111 Island and his demand that Claiborne should consider himself
a member of his plantation, and relinquish all relation and depen-

Lord Baltimore's Colony, yet they knew 110 reason why they should
render up the rights of the Isle of Kent, more than of any other
place formerly given 10 1110 Colony of Virginia hy his Majesty's
Patent.'’

Baltirnore’s Governo'r. He purchased 1110 land, 1111011 which his
settlement was made, for what, 10 Indians, would be ample remn-
neration‚ they being about moreover 10 abandon their ‹eonntry, as
indeed many of them had already done, in consequence os their
dread of the formidable Susquehannoeks.
