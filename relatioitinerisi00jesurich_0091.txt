It is acknowledged that the situation of the
country is excellent and very convenient, as it
extends to the 38th or 40th degree of latitude, -and
is in location and climate not unlike Spain, Sicily,
Jerusalem, and the best parts of Arabia Felix.
The climate is serene and mild, not oppressively
hot like that of Florida and old Virginia, nor
bitter eold like that of New England: but pre-
serves, so to spe-ak, a middle temperature between
the two, and so enjoys the advantageS, and escapes
the evils, of each. On the east it is washed by the
ocean3 on the west it borders upon an almost
boundless continent, which extends into the Chinese
Sea. There are two very large arms of the sea,
both of them bays abounding in fish3 one of these,
named the Ches—peack, is 1200 paces wide, and
spread out between two districts, runs northward a
hundred and sixty miles. It is navigablc for
large ships, and is interspersed with various large
islands suit-able for grazing3 and at these islands

can be caught, in the greatest abundance, the fish

called shad.(¹⁶>
