. . . The narrowest. . . . At the present time alm, as is seen to-
day, this erossing is shorter than any other in the whole course
of the river. It is easy, then, to infer from this, that the fleet
sailed to the island in question, but not to St. Gom-gen Island or
elsewhere3 for there is no other narrower erossing place anywlwre
on the river.

In addition to this, the island was nine leugues (01¹ twenty-
seven miles) from the mouth of the river, which is now called St.
Mary's‚ as will appear in this letter, page 36. Now, indeed, this
is the exact distance between Herons’ Islancl and the mouth of
St. Mary's River or bay, which the pilgrims then ealled St.
George's. Moreover, St. George's bland, which goes by the
same nalne to-day, is situated just at the lnoulh os the river, and
from the western extrelnity of this island, by making· a circuit of

only three miles, you ean enter the main sti-cam of lhe river.
