mentions, in 1110 same plaee, that Georgo met with a 11111511 re-
ceptimr, not indeed from 1110 governor of Virginia, (Sir John
Harvey, who was the first governor appointed hythe King, and
by whom the ‹eompany of 11101011111115, whieh before ruled 1110
whole country, was broken 11p; and thus 0111110 more. direetly
under 1110 0001101 and management of the King) but from the
Assembly of the Provinee.

This body, as Georgo was a Catholie, prohibited him from aequir-
ing property in Virginia, and forhade him to settle there7 unless he
would swear to recognize the spiritual supremaey of the King of
England, and unless his Catholie followers would hind themselves
hythe same oath. George refused, and turned his attention 10-
wards exploring the northern shore of the Potomae river and 1110
neighboring regions, to see whether he eonld not, by good fortune,
find some pleasant and fertile lands, to which he eould eonve-
niently lead his eolonists, and estahlish 111010 11 50111001001 for
0111001105, where they would 110 nndisturbed.

For, although the 1111015 of land, which were afterwards known
hy the name of Maryland, were formerly assigned to Virginia hy
James the First, yet the company of merehants, to whom 110 had
granted those lands, as a part of Virginia, having become extinet,
they had again, at length, fallen into the hands of the King, who
could at that time, bestow them upon any one, according to his
own pleasure.

It is not indeed certain, as Bozman says from any testimony
of men, or historie-al reeords, that George, after he lest Virginia,
turned 1115 course to the north and sailed into the Chesapeake Bay,
to see the country, or its inhabitants. Yet, a man of his wisdom,
and eherishing the design which he did, ought not to have omitted
this investigation. But, however that may be, he had already
returned to England in the year 1631, and requested from Chai-les
the First, that the district, whieh extends northwards from the
Potomae, should be granted to him and 1115 110115.
