The watchful care 01 Divino Providenee eon-
soled us 101 1110 bitter harshness ot' men. For we
understood that a Spanish fieet was stationed off
the island 01 Bonavista, to keep all foreigners
from engaging in the salt trade. If, keeping 10
our appointed route, we had gone on thither, we
should have fallen into the net, and become the
prey 01 0111· enemies. In 1110 meantime, we were
delivered from a greater danger at Barbadoes:
the se1·vants(¹³) throughout the whole island had
conspired 10 kill their masters, then, indeed,
after having gained their liberty, it was their
intention to possess themselves 01 1116 first ship
which should touch there, and venture to sea.
The conspiracy was disclosed by one who was
deterred by the atrocious eruelty 01 1110 enter·
prise3 and the punishment 01 0116 01 1110 leaders
was sufficient for the security 01 1110 island and
0111 own safety. For 0111 ship, as being the first
to touch there, had been marked 101 111611 prey3
and on the very day we landed, we found eight
hundred men in arms 10 oppose this wicked
design, which had just transpired.

The Island 01 Barbadoes is 30 miles in length
and 16 111 breadth3 it is 13 degrees from 1116 equa-
tor, and the climate is so warm, that the inhah-
itants in the winter months wear linen clothes and
bathe frequently. It was harvest time when we
arrived. It would be impossible 10 live there,
