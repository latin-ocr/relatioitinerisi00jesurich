for it is evident (see below) that this father was in authority over
the whole Mission in the year 1640. From this it is inferred, that

. . . Four PriestS. Who is this fourth one? Probably Father
John Brock, or Father Philip Fisher, who was over the whole
Mission from 1637 to 1642, at the age of forty-seven. If he had
been a Missionary Noviee at that time, he would not have been
made Superior, inasmueh as he would not have been acquainted
either with the eustolus or the languages of the country.

. one assistant . . . in the year 16353 two were mentioned.
What has become of one of these?

(C.) P. 55. Quis ille juvenis Missionarius fuerit? Id solum
patet, eum venisse 111 Marylandiam anno 1637. exeunte, vel initio
anni 1638. Sed culn, eo defuneto, Sacerdotes non tres superstites
essent, et anno 1636 quatuor numerabantur, seilicet Patres A.
white, Jo. Altham, Phil. Fisher et Jo. Broc-k, oportuit unum ex
illis tune abfuisse; nullus 0111111 ex his quatuor interierat, nam l'.
JO. Altham obiit anno 1640. 5. Nov. in urbe S. Mariae. (vid.
