eod—fish are caught all the year round3 but the
most convenient time to catch them is in the
eolder months, for the warni weather interferes
with salting them. Now this great abundancc of
fish arises from the following cause: the wind,
which uniforinly blows from the Canaries to the
north-east, drives the water of the ocean, and, with
it, the fish into the Gulf of Mexico3 from which,
since there is no escape for it either to the east 01
the south, it is driven with great force towards the
north, and carries with it large numbers of 11511
1110113 the shores of Florida, Virginia, Maryland,
and N ew England. These, fiying from the larger
fish, take refuge in shallow places, where they are

There are various notable rivers. The chief of
these they call the Attolneck, (Potomac,) a naviga-

certain merchant in the last year, exportcd beaver
skins to the value of 4o‚ooo gold crowns, and the
profit of the traffic is estimatcd at thirty fold.

On the plains and in the open fields there is a
great abundance of grass3 but the country is, for
the most part, thickly wooded. There are a great
many hickory trees, and the oaks are so straight
and tall, that beams, sixty feet long and 2} feet
