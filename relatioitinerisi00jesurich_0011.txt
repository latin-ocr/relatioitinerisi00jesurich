ABOU'r the ι1011111132, 11111 Rev. william ll'IeSherry, S. J„ discovered
in the arehives ot' 1110 “Domus I'rofessa Ν of the. Society 111 Romo, 1110
originals of the MSS. which are named on the title page. He earefully
copied these MSS. and plaeed 1110 copies in 1110 Library os Georgetown

white, D. D„ the Faculty of Georgetown College presented to 1110 Mary-
land Historieal Society, a handsome copy of Father MeSherry's tran-
seripts of the Roman MSS. A very excollent translation was made 1111111
this copy in 1110 year 1847, by Nathan C. Brooks, L. L. D., a 11101111101 of
1110 Maryland Histoi-ieal Soc-iety. Several copies of 1110 translation were,
printed, and subsequently, 11 was published 111 ‘¹ Peter Forco's collection
of Historieal Traets,’' vol. ivy No. 12.

The translation of Dr. Brooks'having become exeeedingly rare, tlw,
Maryland Historical 8001015Υ resolved to print, not only, a new transla-
tion of 1110 MSS, but also 10 110001111111115* 11 with 1110 Latin Text. But it
was then discovered 111111 1110 MSS. had unaccountably disappeared 110111
1110 arehives of 1110 Society3 and all efforts 1ο 1000101 1110 volume, or even
to trac-e it, were unavailing. Application was therefore made to 1110
Faculty of Georgetown College for permission 10 make 11 second copy
from 1110 MS. in their Library. After 11111011 1101115* 111 searehing for it,
it was ascertained 111111 Father MeSherry's MS was no longer in the
Library of Georgewwn College, 11111 111 that of Loyola Collega, in Balti-
more. Through the kind offiees ot' Mr. John Murphy, 1110 Faeulty ot'
Loyola College very promptly loaned to the Maryland Historical Soeivty
the MS. in their Library. This was earefully copied, and afterwards
eollated with much pains3 and it is now printed aun-harim, lim-arim, vt
punctuation. In several respeets, (but few of 1110111 however of 111157 1111-
portance,) it differs, in orthography, punctuation, use of eapital letters,
&C., from 1110 copy from which was made the former eopy of the Maryland
Historieal Society, and which was translated by Doetor Bwoks. le
