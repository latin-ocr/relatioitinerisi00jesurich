thirty-nine pagos os the translation, All efforts to procuro the text of
these thirty-nine pagcs have proved fruitless, the Librarians of George-
town and Loyola Colleges having in vain searched sor Father McSher-
ry's transcriptis, which contained it. With the exception of these last
thirty-nine pages, (which arc printed from Foree's Traets,) the translation
here given, is original. It was made by a very competent young scholar,
who has not only eorrectly rendered the originals, but very suceessfully

All the notes and COlnms¹llts of the MSS, as they are sound on the
margin, are printed after the “ Extractss’ In the few notes added by
the Editor, will be notieed any important variations between the trans-
lation of Dr. Brooks and the text now first published, as well as a few
things, which seemed of interest to elueidate the narrative. It may be
proper to add that a Latin text of the “Relatio ’' and the “De‹elm·a.ti0,¹’
as it seems to have been written in the copy translated by Dr. Brooks,
was printed in 1872, in the “WVoodstoek Letters‚⁷³ with a revision of
the translation of Dr. Brooks‚ for private eireulation amongst the 1110111-
bcrs of the S. J.
¹ The value of this publication, will of course, be variously estimatcd by
the persons⁷ into whose hands it may come: the Maryland Historieal
Society, however, hopes it has done what will prove of interest, if not of
valae, to all who are students of the early history of Maryland.

The Editor takes this occasion to return his thanks to the Presidents
and Faculties of Georgetown and Loyola Colleges, for their ready assist-
ance in the loan of MSS„ and their efforts to find the originals of Father
MeSherry—to William Lucas and John Murphy‚ Esqrs., for their kind
loan of valuable and rare publicatiorm, as the sources of the brief mcmoir
of Father White, in the Appendix‚ and especially to the Rev. John S.
Sumner, S. J„ his ancient college mate and friend, for his constant

interest and valuable suggestions, as the pages were passing through the

presa E. A. D.
