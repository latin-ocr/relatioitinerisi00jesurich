Sailing hence to the fortunate isles, we were
received in a large Bay, where there 15 nothing
to be feared excepting the cahus, but since these
last fifteen days and 5011101111105 three weeks, the
supplies of the navigators give out. But this
rarely happens, scarcely once or twice in a
century. cherthelcss very frequent delays are
unavoidable, on account of the wind's failing,
which, when it blows, is always one and 1110
same, being favorable to this voyage 01 ours.
When we arrived at this bay, we had sailed
three thousand Italian 1111105 under full sail,
passing over a milk-white sea, without being de·
layed at all by calms, except occasionally, for a
single hour, about mid-day.

Ι cannot easily discover the cause 01 511011 11
constant wind, unless, perchance, one should say
it arises from the sun's being 50 near, as it
passes between the tropics, and from the fact
that it draws froin the sea, by the power 01 115
110111, two kinds 01 vapor, 1110 one dry from the
saltness 01 1110 sea, the other meist by reason 01
the water: the wind proceeds from the former,
and from the latter are produced 1110 rains3 and
so the 51111 drawing both towards itself, is the
cause of their always keeping the same oblique
course with the sun, and constantly following 11.
And this, too, may have been the reason, why wc
met with great heat and an abundancc of rain,
