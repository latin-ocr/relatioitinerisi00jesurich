years hc was joined by several missionaries from Europe3 the
names of Fathers Brook, Philip Fisher, Roger Rigby are men·
tioned. On the authority of a MS. document ascribed to Arch-
bishop Carroll, (the first Arehbishop of the United states) it has
been stated that Father White returned, in person, to Europe,
and brought back several missionaries to aid him in his labors in
Maryland—the names of Fathers Harkey and Perret (Parrot)
