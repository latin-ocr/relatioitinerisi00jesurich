I had been eng-rossed. . . . . Saint Paul, indeed, in
relating· the savors granted him from heaven, speaks of himself as
of a third person. But wh)v does the writer of this letter seem to
lay aside his modest5‚ in giving· his own experienee? Perhaps it
was because he wished, in writing to his Superior, whether he was
the Provincia] of Englaud or the General Head of the Society, to
lay before him a full aeeount of the state of his eonseienee. How-
ever that. may be, it does not appear who that Father was, by
whom this letter was written, uor to whom it was sent.

The Superiores the Marylaud Mission, itis likely, may have
written it3 but it is not established by any proof, as far as I know,
that Father Andrew Whito, (Vitus, as our annals eall him in
Latin) filled this offiee. It is doubtful whether Father John
Broch, (his real name was John Morgan) presided over the

associatos, though it seems to come nearer the truth to say that he

 

did not preside before the year ; but that Father Andrew
did, and so it was proper that this letter should be written by him
to the Very Reverend Father Genera] 3 for it seems to be directed
to hini, since he calls the person to whom he writes by the title of

Your I'alernz'ly‚ as appears in this letter, page 27.
