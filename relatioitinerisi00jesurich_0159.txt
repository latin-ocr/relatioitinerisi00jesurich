As sor the rest, it is evideut from a letter of the Very Revereud
Father General, written on the 15111 May, 1633, to Father I‘hilip
Fisher, that. this Father was the Superior of the Asswciates in
Μαι-11111111. According-ly, 1 suppose that Father Andrew Whitv,
after governing three years, was relieved of the lmrden, and that
his successor, Father Philip Fisher, directed the missum sor only
three years3 and Father John Broek was put in his place, as
appears from 11 letter written to him by the Vei-y Reverend
Fathel'· General, on the 15th of September, 1640.

Hence, we have clearly indicated the probable success-ion of
Superiors of Maryland: First, Fathcr Andrew White, in the year
16:343 second, Father Philip Fisher, 16:373 third, Father ,101111
Broek, 16403 fourth,
