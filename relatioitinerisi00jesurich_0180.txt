The “Declaralz'o ⁷' seems to have been prepared for the Gene-
ral of the Socicty of Jesus, or whosoever had the authority to
select, and send out missionaries, for the purpose of giving him
full knowledge of the country, in which Lord Baltimore was about
to establish his Colony. A perusal of it will show, in how many
particulars the author of it was iu error, and how he had been
mislcd by the accounts of fortune-secking travellers in the new
world. It is sad to contrast the glowing accounts of Maryland
in the “Declaratio,’⁷ and the painful experience of the missioua-
ries—the author himself, perhaps, among them—as set out in the

cxtracts from their letters.

 

As the writer of the “Adnotaciones⁷⁷ intimates, on p. 114, the text
of Father McShcrry’s transcript was of doubtful correctness, aud
hence his parenthetical explanations. But even the Annotator is
clearly in error, in several places, in the attempted elucidation of
Fr. McSherry's text. The following are to be noted as the most
important variations between the text of the H. S. and that of
the “ Woodstock Letters.⁷'
